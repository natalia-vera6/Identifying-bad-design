Lab 4.1.1 - Identifying bad design



Using the images in the images folder, this is how I would improve the site 
1. Reduce Ad Intrusiveness and Improve Ad Integration:
    Less Frequent and Less Disruptive Ads: I would significantly reduce the frequency of pop-up ads, interstitial ads, and auto-playing video ads. Instead, I'd explore less intrusive ad formats integrated more seamlessly within the content flow.


2. Enhance Visual Design and Layout:
    Cleaner and More Modern Aesthetic: Update the visual design with a more contemporary look and feel. This would involve better use of white space, clearer typography, and a more consistent visual hierarchy.

    Improved Article Layout: Optimize article pages for readability. This includes breaking up large blocks of text, using more subheadings and bullet points, and ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background.

    Prioritize Key Content: Ensure that the main article content is the most prominent element on the page, with less visual clutter from excessive sidebars, related articles, and social media widgets (these can still be present but less overwhelming).


3. Improve Navigation and Search:
    More Intuitive Navigation: Streamline the main navigation to make it easier for users to find the categories and topics they are interested in. Consider user testing to identify areas of confusion.


4. Re-evaluate Multi-Page Articles and Slideshows:
    User-Centric Content Presentation: Carefully consider whether breaking articles into numerous pages or using multi-page slideshows truly benefits the user or if it primarily serves to increase page views. If it hinders the reading experience, explore alternative ways to present the information.
